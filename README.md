Easily protect your servers against **X**/**Twitter** URLs.

**Ban X** will automatically delete messages that contain URLs known to link to **X** (formerly **Twitter**). This may additionally support URLs that **share the same values** as the **X** platform.

This is a harm-free way to keep your server safe. It doesn't kick or ban users for posting these links, it instead deletes their message and lets them know why it was harmful.
